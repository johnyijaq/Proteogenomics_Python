#This Python script reads a FASTA file, extracts sequences, translates them into protein sequences based on the three possible reading frames (ORFs), 
#and writes the translated sequences to an output file. It uses the Bio module from Biopython for handling sequence data. Here's a breakdown of the code:

import sys  #sys: Used to handle command-line arguments (sys.argv).
from Bio import Seq,SeqIO    #Bio.Seq and Bio.SeqIO: Modules from Biopython used for handling sequences and parsing sequence files (in this case, FASTA).
from Bio.Alphabet import IUPAC   #IUPAC: A Biopython class representing the standard genetic code (this import is unused in the code).

#sys.argv[1] and sys.argv[2] refer to command-line arguments for the input (FASTA file) and output (text file) filenames, respectively.
handle=open(sys.argv[1],'r')   # Open the input FASTA file in read mode
output=open(sys.argv[2],'w')   # Open the output file in write mode

#This loop iterates over each sequence record in the input FASTA file using SeqIO.parse, which returns SeqRecord objects.
#The sequence record.seq is extracted and translated into protein sequences in three reading frames:
#ORF1 starts from the first nucleotide.
#The .translate() function from Biopython converts the nucleotide sequences into amino acids.

for record in SeqIO.parse(handle,'fasta'):
    seq=record.seq
    ORF1=seq.translate()  #Translation of the first reading frame
    ORF2=seq[1::].translate()   # Translation of the second reading frame (shifted by 1 nucleotide)
    ORF3=seq[2::].translate()   # Translation of the third reading frame (shifted by 2 nucleotides)

    #If the record doesn't have an ID, it prints the description and sequence to the console and skips to the next record.
    #For each sequence, the three translated ORFs are written to the output file in FASTA format. The IDs are appended with _ORF1, _ORF2, or _ORF3 to indicate the reading frame.
    
    if record.id=="":
        print(record.description, record.seq)
        continue
    output.write("%s\n%s\n" % ('>'+record.id+'_ORF1',ORF1))
    output.write("%s\n%s\n" % ('>'+record.id+'_ORF2',ORF2))
    output.write("%s\n%s\n" % ('>'+record.id+'_ORF3',ORF3))
            
handle.close()

output.close()
